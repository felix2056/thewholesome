                        <p>trees absorb carbon dioxide &amp; other pollutants, helping to clean air and regulate
                            climate.</p>
                        <p>The time between our&nbsp;donation and the actual tree planting will vary depending on the
                            region we&nbsp;have chosen and the time of year. Planting usually happens during the rainy
                            season, when the soil provides optimum conditions for tree survival.</p>

                            <p>Aside from planting trees, we are also committed to reducing our impact on the planet in
                                other ways. You may notice your&nbsp;order came in a parcel bag that is compostable!
                                That's right, these bags are home compostable. We use mailers by <em>The Better
                                    Packaging Co</em> and also use eco-friendly, soy ink dyed, acid free tissue paper
                                and stickers from <em>noissue.</em>&nbsp;</p>
                            <p>We also request from our suppliers that they do not send our stock individually plastic
                                wrapped. All of our clothing comes in bags made from cassava starch and we&nbsp;use home
                                decomposable packing peanuts.</p>
