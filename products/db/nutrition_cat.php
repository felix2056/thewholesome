After the success of the bestselling cookbook Elsa's Wholesome Life, I am back with 'The Global Vegan', a collection of simple and delicious recipes inspired by my travels around the world to places such as Indonesia, India, Korea and Japan.
<br>
There are vibrant smoothie bowls or vegan fried eggs for easing into the morning; Salt and Pepper 'Calamari', Tom Kha Gai Soup or Aloo Jeera when you need something more substantial; and chai-spiced cookies or Portuguese custard tarts to have with an afternoon cuppa. There are also healthy, plant-based versions of well-known favourites, such as Pad Thai, Fish and Chips and Spicy Ramen Soup.
<br>
I am a qualified dietitian, hence this book explains everything you need to know about adopting a plant-based diet, including how to get enough iron and achieve the right balance of carbs, proteins and good fats.";

When it comes to a vegan Christmas, you may be wondering what dishes we have designed since a typical Christmas dinner or lunch consists of a spread of baked veggies, gravy and a variety of cooked meat. The meat usually being the star of the table. For this reason I decided to put together this mini e-book which contains 20 wholesome vegan Christmas recipes that won't leave you feeling left out this Christmas.
<br>
We've included some hot dinner dishes such as a plant based 'chicken' and gravy (made 100% from vegetables) herbed baked jackfruit 'pulled pork' and some fresh filling salads such as a creamy potato salad PLUS of course some tasty Christmas desserts like gingerbread and pavlova. 
<br>
Eating vegan doesn't have to feel lonely this Christmas because your whole family can enjoy these recipes too!
